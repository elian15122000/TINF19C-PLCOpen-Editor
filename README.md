The students who developed this project are

1. Mouaz Tabboush
2. Leonie de Santis
3. Elian Yildirim
4. Franziska Kopp

The goal of this project is to develop a web version of the PLCOpen-Editor that supports the languages Sequential Function Chart and Function Block Diagram. It is supposed to be an easy tool to program a programmable logic controller without needing a lot of knowledge about the concrete syntax of the languages.
